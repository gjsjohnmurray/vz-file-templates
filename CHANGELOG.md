# Change Log

## 1.0.4
  - Unused language server proxy class removed

## 1.0.3
  - Custom variables constructor js definition changed as previous version was calculating variables only once during first load. Now it should export createVariables function that can be used to create and update list of variables. If function is not defined, old approach will still work.
  - Missing "wizardName" property added to template.json file schema  

## 1.0.2
  - Updated node packages references
  - Extension requires Visual Studio Code 1.26.0 now
  - template.json file schema added, so VSCode shows descriptions of template file properties
  - New $guid$ template variable added

## 1.0.1
  - Template allows to specify list of names of files that should be opened at the end of processing. It can be used if files are created by external command.
  - ITemplateRunSettingsProcessor interface added. It allows to  implement additional logic populating template variables in dependent extensions. 

## 1.0.0
  - It seems that extension has enough basic functionality, so it can finally be called "version 1.0.0"

## 0.0.6

     (paths will be automatically ensured)
   - [FIX] - fixed $day$ variable value
